"If you set :tag:`[General]AllyParaDropNum` to a list of integers so as to"
" send multiple :type:`InfantryTypes` in the paradrop (and thus multiple "
"paradrop planes) then the SpyPlane super weapon would also send the same "
"number of planes as there were elements in that list. In :game:`Ares`, "
"the number of spy planes sent out is now specified by the super weapon's "
"own :tag:`SpyPlane.Count` flag (which defaults to :value:`1`)."
