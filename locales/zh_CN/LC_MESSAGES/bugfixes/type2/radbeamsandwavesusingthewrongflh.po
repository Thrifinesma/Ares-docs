"The weapon effects of Radiation Beams and Waves (Sonic and Magnetron "
"Beams) would always get drawn from the FLH of the firing unit's current "
"primary weapon rather than from the FLH of the weapon that actually fired"
" the beam/wave. Now the weapon effects will be drawn using the correct "
"FLH."

"The Magnetron (:tag:`[TELE]`) does not have a :tag:`SecondaryFireFLH` set"
" in the unmodded game, so any mod using :game:`Ares` will need to set "
"this themselves. You may also need to correct the FLHs for the IFV "
