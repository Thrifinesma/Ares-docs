":tag:`[AudioVisual]DigSound` is used for both the global Nuke siren and "
"the sound made when a subterranean unit (with "
":tag:`Locomotor={4A582743-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}`) digs into or "
"emerges from the ground. With :game:`Ares`, the super weapon can specify "
"its own :tag:`SW.ActivationSound` (which defaults to "
":tag:`[AudioVisual]DigSound` for nukes)."
