":tag:`ProduceCashDelay` was handled differently than other timers, as it "
"fired one frame earlier than expected. This might have been done to "
"distinguish from buildings that don't produce cash, because their timer "
"is always set to 0."

"If the timer expired, it would not be reset. This did not only happen for"
" cash producing buildings, but also if a cash producing building was "
"attacked by a :tag:`Temporal=yes` weapon at the time the timer reached "
"and passed 1 without being reset. The consequence was that the building "
"would stop producing cash until captured by and recaptured from a "
":tag:`MultiplayPassive=yes` house."

"Both issues have been fixed. The full :tag:`ProduceCashDelay` is now used"
" and the timer will be reset correctly."

"Also, the delay never started if :tag:`ProduceCashStartup` was "
":value:`0`. In :game:`Ares` it will start anyhow."
