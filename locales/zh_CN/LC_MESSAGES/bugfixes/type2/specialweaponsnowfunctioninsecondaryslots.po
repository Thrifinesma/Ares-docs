"Units with weapons that use :tag:`MindControl=yes`, :tag:`Parasite=yes` "
"or \\ :tag:`Temporal=yes` require special treatment behind-the-scenes in "
"order to function. However, the original game only performed this "
"treatment if those units had such weapons as their :tag:`Primary` weapon."
" The treatment would not be applied for :tag:`Secondary` weapons and thus"
" result in crashes. :game:`Ares` performs the treatment for "
":tag:`Secondary` weapons too."

"The 'special treatment' sets up the object wielding these weapons. "
"However, the original code is not designed to handle an object having "
"more than one weapon with 'special' functionality so it is not "
"recommended to have multiple weapons with the same type of special "
"functionality on a single object."
