"If armed vehicles using the teleport locomotor carry passengers, they "
"cannot deploy using the keyboard or the Advanced Command Bar while still "
"phasing in after a move order. Yet, using the mouse on the vehicle gives "
"the deploy cursor and, when clicked, the passengers are ejected "
"successfully. This inconsistency has been resolved and phasing in "
"vehicles are not allowed to deploy any longer."
