"Infantry sent into an Armory or old-style Tech Hospital emerge a few "
"moments later, having had the relevant benefit applied (e.g. promotion or"
" healing). However, if the building were destroyed, sold or undeployed "
"whilst the :type:`InfantryType` were still inside then that "
":tag:`InfantryType` would remain in 'limbo' whilst still counting towards"
" the owning player's units (e.g. defeat conditions, build limit, etc). "
":game:`Ares` will make sure that such :type:`InfantryTypes` are ejected "
"from the building in those situations."
