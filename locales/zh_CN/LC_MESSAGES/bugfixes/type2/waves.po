":tag:`IsMagBeam=yes` waves would not disconnect from their target if it "
"moved out of weapon's range of the firing unit. The unit would no longer "
"fire, but the beam would persist. If the wave dealt :tag:`AmbientDamage`,"
" this would still be applied though."

":tag:`IsSonic=yes` waves were hardcoded to disappear if they were farther"
" away from their source than six diagonal cells, equaling a cell range of"
" about 8.5. If the weapon's range was longer than that, the sonic waves "
"would dissolve before reaching their target."

msgid ""
":tag:`IsLaser` and :tag:`IsBigLaser` waves were always invisible if the "
"detail level wasn't set to high. This was unlike all other waves and was "
"most likely a leftover from :game:`Tiberian Sun`, where these kinds of "
"waves were used to give lasers drawn by the actual laser line drawing "
"mechanism a more detailed glow."
