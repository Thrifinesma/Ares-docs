"Because of a bad algorithm selling a building could go into an infinite "
"loop. The game ensures to at most spawn one infantry unit having "
":tag:`Engineer=yes` set by just generating a new crew member until it has"
" :tag:`Engineer=no` set. If there are only crew types (set in "
":tag:`AlliedCrew=`, :tag:`Technician=`, :tag:`Engineer=` and others) with"
" :tag:`Engineer=yes`, this will never succeed and the game will freeze."

"When :tag:`Technician=`, :tag:`Engineer=`, :tag:`AlliedCrew=` and others "
"weren't defined, the game crashed when a building was sold or destroyed. "
"This was just because of oversights in both cases."

"When selling, the flawed :tag:`[InfantryType]Engineer=yes` check happened"
" before the crew type was verified to be set at all."

msgid ""
"When destroyed, the game checked whether the crew type was set, but then "
"went ahead and tried to write the name of the crew type to the debug log "
"regardless of the result."
