"One cause of the NCO bug (where the EVA will announce \"new construction "
"options\" when, in fact, there aren't any) was the game's failure to "
"check if the player had the appropriate factory type to build the unit "
"concerned (e.g. a :type:`VehicleType` factory for :type:`VehicleTypes`). "
"Such a check will now take place, thus removing this cause of the NCO "
"bug."

"Another cause of the NCO bug is when a house is not listed as a buildable"
" building's owner. Ares's prerequisite system does not check for that, "
"thereby eliminating this type of bug."
