"See `Ammo on ModEnc <https://www.modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ammo>`_ for "
"exact details of this problem. Put simply, ammo/reloading logic did not "
"work properly on :type:`BuildingTypes` or :type:`InfantryTypes` and was "
"essentially useless on those object types. :game:`Ares` fixes this logic "
"such that these object types will now reload their ammo properly. Note "
"that :type:`AircraftTypes` are hard-coded to require docking to reload."
