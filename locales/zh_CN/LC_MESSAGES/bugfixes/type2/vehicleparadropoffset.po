"Passengers of :type:`AircraftTypes` get paradropped out if the \\ "
":type:`AircraftType` fires its weapon. The passengers would always use "
"the infantry sub-cell positions for where they would be spawned, even if "
"the passenger were not an :type:`InfantryType`. This ultimately meant "
"that vehicles would appear to fall part-way into the ground upon landing."
" This error no longer happens in :game:`Ares`."
