"The :value:`C4` veteran ability did not work correctly in :game:`Red "
"Alert 2` and :game:`Yuri's Revenge`. Even though infantry could be "
"ordered to use the C4 gained through veterancy, it could not blow up "
"buildings. This has been fixed and the ability now works as it did in "
":game:`Tiberian Sun`."
