"Before :game:`Ares`, upgrades did not appear to work as prerequisites -- "
"if you had the upgrade, you still didn't satisfy the prerequisite. In "
"fact, only the most recently constructed :type:`BuildingType` would be "
"checked to see if it had the upgrade. With :game:`Ares`, all upgrades on "
"all :type:`BuildingTypes` are eligible to satisfy any prerequisite logic "
"that a normal :type:`BuildingType` can."
