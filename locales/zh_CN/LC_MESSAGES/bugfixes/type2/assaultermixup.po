msgid ""
"The game accidentally switched assaulter infantry and victim infantry "
"when an :tag:`Assaulter` infantry raided a building. This messed with "
"several logics as well as with the internal bookkeeping counters, "
"registering the wrong unit as destroyed. A consequence was that the "
"assaulter could be registered as lost multiple times instead of the "
"occupants inside the building, which could fail missions because critical"
" units were apparently lost. This bug has been fixed."
