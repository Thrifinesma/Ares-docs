":tag:`[General]BaseUnit` specifies the list of :type:`VehicleTypes` that "
"are considered to be MCVs. Only the first 3 entries of this list were "
"recognized by the game, which means that additional sides would never be "
"playable in non-Short Games (among other limitations). :game:`Ares` "
"removes this limit so all entries in the list are now recognized."
