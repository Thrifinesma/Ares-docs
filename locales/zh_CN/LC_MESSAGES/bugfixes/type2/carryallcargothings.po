"Carryalls messed with cargo units in a way that would change their "
"rotation speed. This was because the Carryall's current facing along with"
" its :tag:`ROT` value was forced upon the cargo to give the impression "
"that it is actually mounted below the aircraft. When dropping off the "
"cargo, the original values were not restored. :game:`Ares` now does this."
" Also, the facing in which the cargo is dropped off has been changed to "
"be the same as the Carryall facing."

"When a Carryall releases its cargo, it will go on guard mission instead "
"of sitting there frozen. If it was part of a team previously, it will try"
" to rejoin that team. If the unit cannot be placed on the map, it is now "
"put back into the Carryall, instead of potentially disappearing."
