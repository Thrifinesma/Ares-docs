"Railguns with :tag:`AmbientDamage=0` would still deal damage, and even "
"though it would deal 0 hitpoints, this would count as an attack. Certain "
"buildings would special-case a damage of 0 and ensure at last 1 hitpoint "
"of damage is dealt. This does not happen anymore, and :game:`Ares` lets "
"the game skip the damage dealing altogether, so Railguns can now be used "
"just for visual purposes."
