"Buildings were able to use :tag:`Spawns` logic only as long as the "
"spawned :type:`AircraftType` had :tag:`MissileSpawn=no` set, thus could "
"only spawn aircraft like the Destroyer and the Aircraft Carrier. If a "
"building were to spawn a missile, the game would crash. :game:`Ares` "
"fixed the missile handling and thus :tag:`MissileSpawn=yes` no longer "
"crashes the game."
