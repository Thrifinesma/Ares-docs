"If :tag:`TurretCount` is larger than zero, a transport vehicle would not "
"eject the last passenger when deployed. Deploying the unit a second time "
"ejected the remaining passenger. This affected :type:`VehicleTypes` with "
"charge turrets (:tag:`IsChargeTurret=yes`), units with Gattling weapon "
"systems (:tag:`IsGattling=yes`) and IFVs (:tag:`Gunner=yes`)."

msgid ""
"Only :tag:`Gunner=yes` vehicles will keep the last passenger now. They "
"handle passenger pips in a special way as the first pip is separated from"
" the others, and it makes sense for them not to eject the passenger which"
" is considered the \"driver\" and which also controls the weapon used by "
"the transport vehicle."
