":tag:`Gunner=yes` vehicles use the passenger's temporal device to fire if"
" it is equipped with a :tag:`Temporal=yes` weapon. This can be done "
"safely, and the device is replaced once the infantry exits the vehicle. "
"If the :tag:`Gunner=yes` vehicle is also :tag:`OpenTopped=yes`, the "
"infantry with the :tag:`Temporal=yes` weapon inside is still supposed to "
"fire on its own, but because it doesn't have the temporal device any "
"more, the game crashes."
