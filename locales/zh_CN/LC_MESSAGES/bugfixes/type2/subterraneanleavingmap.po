"The Tunnel Locomotor which handles subterranean units contained a bug "
"that caused units to move out of the map. If triggered, the unit would "
"turn around to face the top-left corner, burrow into the ground, and then"
" travel underground into the same direction. Eventually, the unit would "
"be destroyed. This bug is fixed."
