"Animations may have appeared to deal damage randomly rather than based on"
" the warhead specified. In fact, animations were hard-coded to deal "
"damage using the warhead specified by :tag:`[CombatDamage]FlameDamage2`, "
"unless the animation ID was :tag:`[INVISO]`, in which case the warhead "
"used :tag:`[CombatDamage]C4Warhead`. With  :game:`Ares`, the "
":tag:`[Animation]Warhead` flag will be adhered to, with the "
"aforementioned warheads used as the default if :tag:`[Animation]Warhead` "
"is not specified."
