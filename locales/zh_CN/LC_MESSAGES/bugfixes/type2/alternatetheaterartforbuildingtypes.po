":type:`BuildingTypes` whose :file:`artmd.ini` entry has "
":tag:`NewTheater=yes` set would have the second letter of their SHP "
"filenames replaced by another letter, depending on the theater of the "
"current map. For example, :tag:`[GAWEAP]` uses SHP files named "
":file:`GAWEAP*` on arctic maps, :file:`GTWEAP*` on temperate maps, "
":file:`GDWEAP*` on desert maps and so on. In the event that a SHP file "
"with the appropriate filename does not exist, the game falls back to "
":file:`GGWEAP*`."

"However, in :game:`Yuri's Revenge` this filename-adjusting logic only "
"works for :type:`BuildingTypes` whose :tag:`Image` ID starts with G, N, Y"
" or C. :game:`Ares` extends this logic to work for :tag:`Image` IDs "
"starting with any letter (A-Z or a-z)."
