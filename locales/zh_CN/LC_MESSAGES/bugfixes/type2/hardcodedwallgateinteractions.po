"In :game:`Tiberian Sun` you could place buildable gates on top of "
"existing walls. This logic still exists in :game:`Yuri's Revenge`. "
"However, the logic was hardcoded to only work with :tag:`[GAWALL]` and "
":tag:`[NAWALL]`, so it wouldn't work with Yuri's wall (:tag:`[YAWALL]`) "
"or, indeed, any other walls you might add to the game. :game:`Ares` "
"changes this so that all overlays with :tag:`Wall=yes` set can have gates"
" \"slammed\" onto them."
