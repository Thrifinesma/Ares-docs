"In-game :game:`Yuri's Revenge` originally only fully supported compressed"
" shape images up to a width of 256 pixels. The game used a buffer of "
"fixed size with additional data while drawing, and larger images read "
"past the end of that buffer. The vertical lines were a consequence of "
"random data being applied to each line drawn, selectively making the "
"pixels at the same x coordinates transparent."

"This has been fixed. :game:`Ares` uses a large enough buffer to draw "
