"When player-loaded units were paradropped from aircraft, the game failed "
"to update their state correctly. This caused issues because the "
"paradropped units were still linked to the aircraft, and it could cause "
"desyncs and crashes once the aircraft was destroyed. :game:`Ares` fixes "
"this."
