"The map action `Play Sound at Random Waypoint` collected up to 400 "
"waypoints from which it then randomly selected one to play a sound effect"
" at. This could crash, because it had actually only space to store 100 "
"waypoints. If there were more waypoints present on the map, the game "
"would crash. This has been fixed."
