"The original game includes a little-known flag that allows all \\ "
":type:`ObjectTypes` (anything placeable on the map - Projectiles, Trees, "
"Overlays, Smudges (not the :type:`IsometricTileTypes`), Aircraft, "
"Infantry, Vehicles and Buildings) to have a lighting effect displayed on "
"them. \\ :tag:`[ObjectType]AlphaImage=ALPHATST` instructs the game to "
"display :file:`ALPHATST.shp` on the object as a lighting effect. The SHP "
"must be saved without any compression (just like :file:`mouse.sha`)."

"If the SHP has multiple frames then it is interpreted as a multi-facing "
"image, and the largest N frames in the image are used as facing-specific "
"versions (in this case, N is the largest power of 2 that is less than or "
"equal to the number of frames in the SHP, e.g. 2/4/8/16/32/64...). This "
"is supported only for :type:`TechnoTypes`."
