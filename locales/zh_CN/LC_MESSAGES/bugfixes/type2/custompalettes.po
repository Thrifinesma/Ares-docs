"The original game supports custom palettes on :type:`TechnoTypes` using "
":tag:`Palette` (filename, excluding .pal extension) on the "
":type:`TechnoType`'s entry in :file:`artmd.ini`. However, the game would "
"crash (with the message \"You have violated the limit of having only one "
"extra building Palette\" in the [non-existent] log file) if you used the "
":tag:`Palette` flag more than once. And, of course, the one extra palette"
" was already in use on the Statue of Liberty. :game:`Ares` removes this "
"limit and lets you use custom palettes on all :type:`TechnoTypes` to your"
" heart's content."

"It is not known why this apparently arbitrary limit on custom palettes "
"was in place -- it may have been there to mask a bug that we don't yet "

"When using custom palettes, the modder must make a new palette for each "
"theater. Normally, each building or unit has an associated palette for "
"each theater it can be deployed into (e.g. :file:`unitsno.pal`, \\ "
":file:`unittem.pal`, etc). If the modder creates a new palette, say "
"\"picasso.pal\", in order for that palette to be used in other theatres, "
"the modder must create \"picassosno.pal\", \"picassotem.pal\", etc as "
"well."
