"If the game tries to instantiate a type with an ID longer than 24 "
"characters, :game:`Ares` will show a dialog pointing out the ID used. "
"This happens if a type list includes a too long ID directly, or for "
"example, if the game automatically adds a too long type ID it encountered"
" to the list while parsing an INI section. This always indicates a bug, "
"and this always is a bug present in a modded INI or map file."

"This feature does not catch too long IDs present in INI sections that are"
" not automatically added to the type list while parsing. Searching for "
"the exact ID will just fail. Only if the tag is read by :game:`Ares`, a "
"warning will be emitted in the debug log."
