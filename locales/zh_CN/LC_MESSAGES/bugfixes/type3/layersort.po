"The game function responsible for reordering all objects on the map for "
"drawing was implemented inefficiently. It was bubbling up a single item "
"per frame by comparing two values and swapping them if needed, then "
"looking at the next pair, iterating all objects. During this process, for"
" each comparison it recalculated the values it just used over and over "
"again. The function was not reusing the values of the last comparison it "
"just made, even though one of them would always be needed in the next "
"comparison."

":game:`Ares` replaces the function with a more complex algorithm that "
"should run faster while also giving higher quality results."
