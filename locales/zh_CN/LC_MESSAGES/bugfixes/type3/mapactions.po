"Map events `TechType exists` and `TechType does not exist` were "
"implemented inefficiently. Both iterated all available types each frame "
"to resolve an ID to a type and then iterated all technos to count the "
"number of existing technos of this type. :game:`Ares` always caches the "
"type information and also optimizes summing up the techno count by either"
" using the house counters of each house, if the type is "
":tag:`Insignificant=no` and :tag:`DontScore=no` or at least only checking"
" the list of the relevant object type otherwise."
