"There exists a version of :file:`ddraw.dll` that is often touted as "
"improving the performance of :game:`Yuri's Revenge`. This \"magic\" DLL "
"forces DirectDraw into software emulation mode, which doesn't use any "
"hardware accelerated GPU functionality. This means special effects that "
"are not emulated are simply omitted, potentially improving performance. "
":game:`Ares` uses software emulation mode by default, making this DLL "
"unnecessary. However, Windows Vista and later come with DirectX 10 - "
"which does not support software emulation - so :game:`Ares` will not "
"default to software emulation mode on those versions of Windows "
"(otherwise users would just get a completely black screen)."
