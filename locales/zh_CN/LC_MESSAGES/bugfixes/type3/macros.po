"Presumably caused by using preprocessor macros in the source code, some "
"parts of the game call the same functions twice. The macros to select the"
" minimum or maximum of two passed values are most notorious for this "
"behavior. The effect is that a function is unnecessarily called a second "
"time, and if the called function exhibits the same problem, it calls "
"another function two times each. :game:`Ares` fixes some of these "
"function calls."
