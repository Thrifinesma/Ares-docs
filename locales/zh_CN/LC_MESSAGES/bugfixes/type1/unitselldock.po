"In the vanilla game, the Allied Service Depot could be used to sell units"
" that were currently docked, while the Soviet Repair Depot could not. "
"This was because of the different foundation both structures use: If the "
"unit docked at the building's center like for the 3x3 Service Depot, the "
"unit could be sold, while it couldn't on the 4x3 Repair Depot."

":game:`Ares` changes the logic to work with a unit's individual dock "
"position on each building instead. This feature can now be turned on or "
"off per building. See :doc:`Sell Units </new/sellunit>` on how to "
"customize selling units."
