"The random weighting of each possible Secret Lab boon was not calculated "
"correctly -- the later a boon appeared in the list the less likely it was"
" to appear in-game. For example, if the Grand Cannon were not picked as "
"the boon for the first Secret Lab on the map (probability 1/8) then it "
"could not be picked for any of the other Secret Labs. This has been fixed"
" such that every Secret Lab will pick its boon completely at random, "
"independently of other Secret Labs on the map."
