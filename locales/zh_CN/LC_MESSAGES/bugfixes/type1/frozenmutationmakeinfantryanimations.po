"Infantry killed by a mutation warhead appear to transform into another "
":type:`InfantryType`. Internally this is achieved by playing an "
"animation, upon completion of which a new infantry unit is spawned. If "
"the cell where the new infantry is to be spawned is already occupied then"
" the animation will pause on the final frame until the obstacle is "
"cleared."

msgid ""
"The original game would allocate memory for the new infantry on every "
"frame but would fail to de-allocate that memory when the infantry could "
"not be placed. The more time that passes with the animation in this "
"state, the worse the memory leak gets -- resulting in the game eventually"
" grinding to a halt. :game:`Ares` fixes this by simply deleting the "
"animation if the new infantry unit cannot be spawned."
