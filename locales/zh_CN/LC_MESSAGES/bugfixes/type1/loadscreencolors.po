"Westwood did not update the code that selects the load screen text color "
"for :game:`Yuri's Revenge`. The original campaigns always used "
":value:`SovietLoad` red no matter what faction you played as. For the "
"multiplayer game modes, everything that was not Allied got "
":value:`SovietLoad` red, too. :game:`Ares` selects these values: Allies "
"get :value:`AlliedLoad` blue for campaigns and Yuri gets either the new "
":value:`YuriLoad` or :value:`Purple` as fallback in multiplayer."
