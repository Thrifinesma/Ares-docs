msgid ""
"Units under the influence of Chaos gas (from warheads with "
":tag:`Psychedelic=yes`) were supposed to act on their own and not take "
"any orders from their owners, yet a player was still able to use the stop"
" command on them. This could prevent berserking units from attacking and "
"damaging friendly units and thus soften the psychedelic effect. This is "
"no longer possible."
