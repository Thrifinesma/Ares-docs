"Whenever a game mode or map declared the :tag:`[General]` section without"
" re-stating the :tag:`PrismSupportModifier`, the "
":tag:`PrismSupportModifier` from :file:`rulesmd.ini` would get multiplied"
" by 100, thus causing supported Prism Towers to deal extremely high "
"damage. This bug is now fixed. It should be noted that several official "
"maps which used to exhibit this bug were already 'fixed' by the UMP by "
"re-stating :tag:`PrismSupportModifier=150%` in each affected map. As a "
"result of the UMP fixes, these maps are now set at the original 150%, "
"regardless of what your mod may set it to. If you want to change this "
"then you should manually override the global modifier via :game:`Ares`' "
"new Prism Forwarding logic. This can be done simply by adding a single "
"flag to the Prism Tower: "
":tag:`[ATESLA]PrismForwarding.SupportModifier=whatever`"

"Once a Prism Tower had decided to support another, the firing tower "
"gained that tower's benefit. If the supporting tower was destroyed or "
"otherwise incapacitated, the firing tower would still get the full "
"benefit of that tower, even though there are no visual effects drawn (and"
" the supporting tower may even have started supporting another). "
":game:`Ares` fixes this so that incapacitated supporting towers do not "
"contribute to the firing tower."

"Prism Towers could be made to support another during their construction "
"or selling phases. This caused graphical glitches with the tower. "
":game:`Ares` prevents these towers from supporting others."
