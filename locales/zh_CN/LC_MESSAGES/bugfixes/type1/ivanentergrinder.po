"Crazy Ivan always got the Ivan Bomb cursor on an allied Grinder and thus "
"could not be ordered to enter it normally. Once the Grinder was rigged "
"with a bomb, Crazy Ivan was allowed to enter it. Force fire or force move"
" keys could not alter this behavior."

":game:`Ares` changes this so Crazy Ivan gets the enter cursor on allied "
"Grinders by default. Enemy Grinders get the Ivan Bomb cursor. You can "
"still override this behavior if you want to plant a  bomb on a Grinder by"
" pressing the force fire key."
