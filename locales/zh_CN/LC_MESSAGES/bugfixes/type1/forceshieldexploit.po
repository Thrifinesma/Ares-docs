"There is a probability an AI player uses the Force Shield super weapon to"
" defend against a super weapon fired on its base by an enemy player. This"
" also happened when the enemy player was not even allowed to fire the "
"super weapon, maybe because another Lightning Storm was already active at"
" the moment."

"If a super weapon was active, a player owning a charged super weapon of "
"the same type could use it and quickly click on all enemy players' bases "
"to make them use their Force Shield to defend against a super weapon that"
" had its fire sequence aborted, causing them to lose power for a short "
"amount of time."
