"If a parasite (e.g. Terror Drone) entered a unit that can fly (e.g. "
"Nighthawk) and that unit was destroyed by the parasite whilst airborne "
"then the parasite would appear, unscathed, on the ground beneath the "
"destroyed unit. In :game:`Ares`, the parasite will instead appear at the "
"same height as the destroyed airborne unit and fall to the ground - where"
" it will be destroyed by the impact."
