"Voxel Animation damage delivery had two bugs. Firstly, it passed its "
":tag:`Damage` data on the type directly, without making a copy first. The"
" type data thus could change during the course of the game, and the type "
"of Voxel Anim would do less and less damage over time. Secondly, the game"
" could crash if the Voxel Animation had no :tag:`Warhead` defined."

"Both issues have been fixed in :game:`Ares`. If no warhead is set, the "
"Voxel Animation will not deliver any damage."
