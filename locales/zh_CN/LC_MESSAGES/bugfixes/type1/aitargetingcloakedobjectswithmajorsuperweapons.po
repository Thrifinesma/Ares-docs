"When AI controlled super weapons with :tag:`Type=LightningStorm`, "
":tag:`Type=MultiMissile`, :tag:`Type=PsychicDominator`, and "
":tag:`Type=GeneticConverter` picked their target, they failed to ignore "
"cloaked objects (such as Submarines) and, as a result, sometimes selected"
" them as targets, ruining the appearance of fair play. Cloaked objects "
"are no longer considered as targets for these super weapons."
