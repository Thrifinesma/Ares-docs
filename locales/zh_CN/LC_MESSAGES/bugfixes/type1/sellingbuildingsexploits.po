"In :game:`Yuri's Revenge` selling buildings could be exploited to give "
"free crew infantry or to create a virtual MCV which could not be "
"destroyed, the latter keeping the exploiting player alive forever."

"When a re-deployable Construction Yard was sold, it could be ordered to "
"move somewhere while packing up, and the sell order would be converted to"
" a move order. The crew was still ejected from selling, and the player "
"also kept the MCV. If the MCV could not be placed on the map, it would "
"still be kept alive in memory, unable to be destroyed. If the building "
"was destroyed while being sold, it would eject crew a second time."

":game:`Ares` does no longer allow a sell order to be converted into a "
"move order, and it will also not eject crew twice in case the building is"
" destroyed while selling. :game:`Ares` also makes sure the MCV is placed "
"on the map, or it will be taken out of the game, no longer keeping "
"players alive."
