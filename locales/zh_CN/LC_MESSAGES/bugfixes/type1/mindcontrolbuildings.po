"If a mind-controller captured a building and it was either freed or the "
"mind-controller let go of it, the building would just sit there, doing "
"nothing. They didn't even retaliate when fired upon previously. This was "
"because freed units are supposed to go on a hunt mission. Buildings "
"cannot go hunting and so they stayed lethargic."
