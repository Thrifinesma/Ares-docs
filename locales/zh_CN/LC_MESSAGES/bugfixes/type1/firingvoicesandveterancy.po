":game:`Yuri's Revenge` uses different unit voice lists for firing weapons"
" (:tag:`VoicePrimaryWeaponAttack`, :tag:`VoicePrimaryEliteWeaponAttack`, "
":tag:`VoiceSecondaryWeaponAttack` and "
":tag:`VoiceSecondaryEliteWeaponAttack`). If the :tag:`*EliteWeaponAttack`"
" list is empty, :tag:`VoiceAttack` is used instead of the more "
"appropriate non-elite version :tag:`*WeaponAttack`."
