"When the frame rate drops, the game tries to increase it again by turning"
" off certain visual effects like lasers, waves, and electro bolts, and "
"some animations with :tag:`DetailLevel=2`. Lasers will fall back to draw "
"a simpler variant using a bold line, animations disappear, and so on. "
"When the frame rate increases again, the effects are turned back on."

"This did not happen if the game speed is set to a slower frame rate, "
"because then it would always be detected as too low. :game:`Ares` fixes "

" game speeds."
