"If a unit with a multiple burst weapon (:tag:`Burst` > :value:`1`) "
"destroys its target or is assigned a new target before it has fired all "
"shots, the game resets the burst counter, but does not also restart "
"reloading. The result is that the unit can attack the next target "
"immediately, with a fresh set of bursts."

"Given that the delay between bursts is usually shorter than the reload "
"time, this gives an unfair advantage. Given that manually changing "
"targets or issuing a Stop command also resets the burst counter, this can"
" be exploited."
