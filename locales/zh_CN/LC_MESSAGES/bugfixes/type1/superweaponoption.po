"The option to disable super weapons in multiplayer matches had an effect "
"on single player missions also. Thus there was a possibility that players"
" could not use super weapons and could not even build the buildings "
"providing those super weapons if they were "
":tag:`DisableableFromShell=yes`. Other options like the redeployable MCV "
"feature are explicitly prevented from affecting campaigns. Such checks "
"have been added for the super weapon option also, and thus super weapons "
"will always be available in campaign mode."
