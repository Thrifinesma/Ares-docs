"Infantry could gain experience killing enemies while occupying a "
"structure, but unlike units in :tag:`OpenTopped` vehicles (and with "
":game:`Ares` with :tag:`Gunner` vehicles also), occupiers are not "
"promoted immediately. They had to exit the building first, and only after"
" doing this would they use the elite weapon when occupying a structure "
"again."

"With :game:`Ares`, the promotion now happens immediately and without "
"exiting, but it is silent, that is, no sound will play."
