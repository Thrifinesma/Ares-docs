"The code generating checksums to compare game state to detect "
"desynchronisations had a bug and wrote into memory beyond class bounds. "
"It is not clear whether this caused any trouble, as memory management is "
"highly dynamic and depends on too many factors like OS version, other "
"running programs, and game state. In any case, this was a coding error "
"which has been fixed."
