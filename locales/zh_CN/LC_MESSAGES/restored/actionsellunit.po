"In :game:`Tiberian Sun` you could sell units that were docked with a "
"structure by using the normal Sell button on the sidebar. In "
":game:`Yuri's Revenge`, a super weapon with :tag:`Action=SellUnit` "
"achieves the same function. However, if such a super weapon were fired on"
" a unit inside a Tank Bunker then an Internal Error would occur "
"(sometimes this would be delayed until the destruction of the Tank "
"Bunker). :game:`Ares` prevents the error occurring."
