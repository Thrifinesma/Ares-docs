"Laser Fences used to work in :game:`Red Alert 2` and :game:`Yuri's "
"Revenge` 1.000 but stopped working with the arrival of the 1.001 patch, "
"in that the 'lasers' never turned on (this appears to have been an "
"incidental change and not something Westwood did intentionally)."

"Laser Fences now work just the same as they did in :game:`Tiberian Sun`. "
"You need a :type:`BuildingType` with :tag:`LaserFencePost=yes` to act as "
"a corner post, and another :type:`BuildingType` with "
":tag:`LaserFence=yes` which will be placed in between the corner posts "
"automatically (see the original building's SHP from :game:`Tiberian Sun` "
"to see how the art is controlled). These fences are impassable to ground "
"objects and invulnerable to normal damage, but when a corner post is "
"destroyed, the fences connected to it are lost. When the corner post "
"loses power, the fences connected to it go offline and become freely "
"passable. When the post regains power, the fences reactivate and any "
"object unfortunate enough to be traversing them will be destroyed."
