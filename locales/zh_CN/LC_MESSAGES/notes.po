":game:`Ares` is not intended to be used in conjunction with any third "
"party patch that modifies the executable of the game. :game:`Ares` works "
"by having its code injected into :game:`Yuri's Revenge` at very specific "
"points, and modifications to the executable change the locations of these"
" points. This would lead to :game:`Ares`'s code being injected in the "
"wrong places, leading to unforeseeable, bad consequences."

"Unfortunately, :game:`Ares` will not simply \"work\" without changes to "
"the original game files. The reason for this is that maintaining "

"enhancements that are :game:`Ares`' raison d'Ãªtre would make implementing"
" :game:`Ares` features (both for us, the developers, and you, the mod "
