"Particle handling has been greatly optimized in :game:`Ares`. Pixel "
"particles -- that is types having :tag:`BehavesLike=` set to either "
":value:`Spark` or :value:`Railgun` -- were known to cause lag even with "
"relatively few particles involved. That is, even sparse railgun beams "
"created a noticeable slowdown. Also, :value:`Smoke` particles are created"
" frequently throughout a game."

"In :game:`Ares` the optimization is activated automatically if all of the"
" following are true. If any one is false, the optimization will not be "
"applied and the particles will be handled like in earlier versions. That "
"is, mixing and matching is still possible."
