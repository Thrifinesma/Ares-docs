"The game is hard-coded to do certain things with certain unit IDs. Namely"
" the :tag:`[COW]` and :tag:`[DESO]`. These units can now have said "
"special properties switched off, and other units can be given these "
"properties if you want. Hard-coded properties of Cows and Desolators can "
"be toggled on/off for any infantry."
