"When a unit is moving, :tag:`WalkRate` is used to control the unit's "
"animation, when it is idle, :tag:`IdleRate` is used. A unit counted as "
"idle if it wasn't moving, which also included taking off, landing and "
"hovering, and thus helicopter style units would not play their rotor "
"animation even if they clearly were in air. :game:`Ares` adds a new tag "
"for this situation."
