"New cursors can be added and default cursors can be changed using the new"
" :tag:`[MouseCursors]` section, which centralizes cursor definitions in "
"one place. Each cursor has a name, which can then be used as valid value "
"for tags asking for a mouse cursor. Cursors are defined in a single line "
"with comma-separated values as follows:"

":tag:`Name` can be up to 31 characters long. Enter the values in the "
"given order, separated by commas: "

"fewer items are defined, the remaining values are defaulted."

":value:`MiniFrame` is like :value:`Frame`, except this is for the mouse "

":value:`HotSpot` specifies the point from which the click event will "
"handled. :value:`HotSpotX` should be one of :value:`Left`, "
":value:`Center` or :value:`Right`. :value:`HotSpotY` should be one of "
":value:`Top`, :value:`Middle` or :value:`Bottom`. For example, "
":value:`Left,Top` will treat the top-left corner of the cursor as the "
"tip. Default is :value:`Left,Top`."

":game:`Ares` adds several new named cursors by default, which are used "
