"Radial Indicators were a feature for buildings that could visualize the "
"range of its weapons or of some ranged effect it provided like a Stealh "
"Generator. The radius was determined automatically by checking certain "
"functions the building had, and it could only be turned on or off using a"
" setting."

msgid ""
"With :game:`Ares` it is possible to customize the range with a setting, "
"which could be used to override the automatically picked radius, or to "
"give a Radial Indicator to a building that by default would not have one."
" Radial Indicators can now also be enabled for units."
