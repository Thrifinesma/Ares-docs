"Hijacking works well together with Mind Control now. If a mind-controlled"
" unit is captured, the connection to the controller is broken and there "
"will be no bogus links left behind. Likewise, mind-controlled hijackers "
"will capture vehicles for their original owning houses, not for their "
"capturers'. The mind-control link will be transferred to the captured "
"vehicle, if it isn't immune to mind control. Otherwise, the mind-"
"controller loses control over both hijacker and its victim. Same is true "
"for the opposite case: When a hijacked and mind-controlled unit is "
"destroyed, the link is transferred to the hijacker, if it isn't immune to"
" psionics."
