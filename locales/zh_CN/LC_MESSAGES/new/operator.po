"Specifies a list of :type:`InfantryType`\\ s and :type:`VehicleType`\\ s "
"of which at least one unit must be among the passengers before this "
"object will function. If \":value:`_ANY_`\" (sans quotes) is specified, "
"then it does not matter which passenger is inside, as long as any is. Use"
" :value:`none` to remove the requirement of having an operator. Defaults "
"to :value:`none`."

"If the needed passenger is not inside then the :type:`TechnoType` will "
"power down in a similar fashion to the Robot Tank when the Robot Control "

"Units and structures will not cloak themselves if they are not operated, "

"Operator logic will render :type:`VehicleTypes` with "

msgid ""
"Assuming you manage to get an aircraft to a place where the Operator can "
"board it, if the aircraft can attack then the act of attacking will cause"
" the passengers (including the Operator) to parachute from the aircraft -"
" whereupon it will crash."

#: ../new/operator.rst:67
msgid ""
"The AI behaves unpredictably when faced with units that require Operators"
" and may not be subject to certain effects. You should prevent the AI "
"from building anything that requires an Operator."
