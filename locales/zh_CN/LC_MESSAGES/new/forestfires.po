"Forest fires were a feature of :game:`Tiberian Sun`. Trees were set on "
"fire if hit by a :tag:`Sparky=yes` warhead. While burning, they could "
"ignite trees nearby and thus over time spread like a wildfire."

":game:`Ares`'s implementation of forest fires slightly differs from the "
"one in :game:`Tiberian Sun`. It is now required to also set the "
"previously unused tag :tag:`IsFlammable=yes` on each tree that may be set"
" on fire. This is the only noticeable change."

"See `Sparky on ModEnc <https://www.modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Sparky>`_ "
"for a more detailed description of the logic, and for the requirements to"
" get it working. To prevent crashes when firing a :tag:`Sparky=yes` "
"warhead, do not forget to set three valid animations as "
":tag:`[AudioVisual]OnFire` and two valid animations as "
":tag:`[AudioVisual]TreeFire`."

"If trees are not burning down, make sure that the animation used as \\ "
