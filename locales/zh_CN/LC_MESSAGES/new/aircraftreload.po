"Aircraft only have a global tag for defining how long it takes to reload "
"their ammunition, which is difficult to balance for different types of "
"aircraft firing few powerful missiles and aircraft firing lots of weak "
"machine gun rounds. In :game:`Ares`, each type can have its own "
":tag:`ReloadRate`."

"For this feature to work the reloading has also been changed to reload "
"each aircraft individually. This fixes the issue that reload times seemed"
" to vary for aircraft and the aircraft that landed first was reloaded "
"substantially faster as it required one less interval of "
":tag:`ReloadRate`."
