"This super weapon uses the Charge/Drain logic: once activated, the effect"
" will persist for a duration determined by :tag:`SW.ChargeToDrainRatio`, "
"after which it will automatically shut down and the superweapon will "
"restart its charging process."

"Whilst the effect is active, players can click the super weapon button "
"again to manually deactivate it, thus allowing the recharge process to "
"begin earlier and finish faster. See :ref:`Charge/Drain <charge-drain-"
"sw>`, or refer to `ModEnc "
"<https://www.modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ChargeToDrainRatio>`_ for more "
"information about Charge/Drain logic."

"In :game:`Tiberian Sun`, the Charge/Drain feature was disableable through"
" an INI flag (:tag:`[SuperWeapon]UseChargeDrain=no`) however: "
":game:`Ares` forces this logic to be used regardless of the value of that"
" flag. :game:`Ares` also forces this super weapon to ignore its assigned "
":tag:`Action`, if any, as this is required to make it activate from a "
"single click of the sidebar icon."

"The AI will not use this super weapon. In missions, it is possible to "
