"Buildings can display specific animations for when the attached super "
"weapon is charging, is nearly charged (1 minute remaining in the vanilla "
"game), is ready to be fired, and when it fires. However, in :game:`Yuri's"
" Revenge`, these animations only work properly for the original super "
"weapons. In :game:`Ares`, these will work for any super weapon."
