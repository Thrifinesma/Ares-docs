"In :game:`Yuri's Revenge`, there is very little you can do to change or "
"add to the existing super weapons -- most super weapon-related features "
"are hard-coded to only work as designed for the original super weapons. "
":game:`Ares`, however, includes several new ways to customize existing "
"super weapons as well as several wholly new super weapons."

"You cannot change a super weapon's :tag:`Type=` or :tag:`Action=` values "
"in any of the game mode specific INI files (like \\ "
":file:`mpfreeforallmd.ini`) or map files. To achieve the same effect, add"
" a new super weapon to :file:`rulesmd.ini` with the different "
":tag:`Type=` or \\ :tag:`Action=` and change :tag:`SuperWeapon=` for the "
"respective owner buildings to use the new super weapon in the INI file "
"instead."
