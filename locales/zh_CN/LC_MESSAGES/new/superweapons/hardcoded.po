"It made no sense to have the values :tag:`PreClick`, :tag:`PostClick`, "
"and :tag:`PreDependent` customizable. :game:`Ares` hardcodes these values"
" and they have no effect any more. Instead, :tag:`SW.PostDependent` takes"

"The super weapon invoked right after firing this super weapon. As in "
":game:`Red Alert 2` the only super weapon using this is the ChronoSphere "
"invoking the ChronoWarp. To distinguish between multiple of such super "
"weapons you can provide the specific super weapon ID here. For example, "
":tag:`[ChronoSphereSpecial]SW.PostDependent=ChronoWarpSpecial` switches "
"to the ChronoWarp type super weapon after you chose the source location."
