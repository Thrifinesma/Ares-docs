"Events that are *persistent* need to be satisfied only once and the game "

" to be satisfied the very instant for the event to fire."

#: ../new/triggerevents.rst:14
msgid ""
"An event is *incidental* if the event is actually satisfied by triggering"
" that very event. Incidental events occur at a specific point in time and"
" are tied to some specific action taking place. An example would be "
":value:`Spied By` (2), which is triggered the moment a Spy enters a "
"building."

"An event is *situational* if it depends on the circumstances of the match"
" and thus is satisfied at any point in time the condition is currently "
"true. That is, the condition is usually satisfied over a period of time "

"This means that a trigger with two non-persistent incidental events will "
