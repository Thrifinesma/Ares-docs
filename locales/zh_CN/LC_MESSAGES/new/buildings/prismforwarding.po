"This option was only really added for testing purposes and doesn't really"
" enhance the look of the support beam so it is recommended that you "
"ignore this option. In the original game, the master (firing) tower "
"enlists just one slave (support) tower per frame. Each slave tower "
"enlisted begins charging at that time and the master tower restarts "
"charging. This gives the effect of having the slave tower beams arrive in"
" quick succession, rather than all at once. This effect is barely "
"noticeable in-game except at slow speeds or if the network has a large "
"number of towers."
msgstr ""

#: ../new/buildings/prismforwarding.rst:114
msgid ""
"In :game:`Ares`, this has been changed so that all adjacent slave towers "
"are enlisted on the same frame. That said, a charge delay has been "
"introduced so that the towers do not all appear to start charging "
"immediately. For each backward-chain in the network, the farthest-forward"
" towers begin charging just that little bit later, to give the effect of "
"the beam travelling along the chain. The amount that each tower will "
"delay starting its charge for can be specified by "
":tag:`PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay`. This delay accumulates for each chain"
" in the prism forwarding network."
msgstr ""

#: ../new/buildings/prismforwarding.rst:123

"So, for example, if :tag:`PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay=2` and you have a "
"prism chain of 3 towers then the farthest tower (tower 3) will begin "
"charging immediately, the middle tower (tower 2) will begin charging "
"after 2 frames and the firing tower (tower 1) will begin charging after a"
" further 2 frames. All towers will be in their charging state on the 4th "
"frame. At firing time, the beams will filter down from the farthest tower"
" to the firing tower. Due to the new way in which the actual power of the"
" beam is transferred across the prism forwarding network, the minimum "
"charge delay is 1, so you cannot have the beams all appear "
"simultaneously. However, at normal game speeds, a charge delay of 1 frame"
" is barely noticeable, unless there is a particularly long chain in the "
"network."
msgstr ""

#: ../new/buildings/prismforwarding.rst:135

"Default charge delay is :value:`1`. Increase this to have the support "

"This allows you to control how thick the laser beam grows as the size of "

"supported by 1 or more other towers would have a :tag:`LaserThickness` of"
" 5 - that's 2 higher than the default :tag:`LaserThickness` of the firing"

"Positive values, on the other hand, tell :game:`Ares` that you want the "
"thickness of the beam to be dependent on the number of backward chains in"

"same way. A :tag:`PrismForwarding.Intensity` value of 1 would cause the "
"farthest beam to have no thickness increase, the next to have an increase"
