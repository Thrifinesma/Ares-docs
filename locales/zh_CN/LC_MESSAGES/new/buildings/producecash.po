"Building upgrades now support :tag:`ProduceCashDelay`, "
":tag:`ProduceCashAmount` and :tag:`ProduceCashStartup` like normal "

":tag:`ProduceCashStartup` has been expanded to support negative values. "

"captured or placed. Also, :tag:`ProduceCashStartup` is no longer granted "
"if a building is captured by a :tag:`MultiplayPassive=yes` house."
