"Buildings can now be made 'solid' to projectiles, meaning that "
"projectiles will detonate when hitting a building rather than passing "
"through it. Units are aware of Solid Buildings, and they will try to find"
" a better firing position when attacking a target and an obstacle is in "
"the way."

"The solid level makes it possible to distinguish between Solid Buildings "
"a unit should consider indestructible and thus move to a better place to "
"attack, and Solid Buildings that should be considered collateral damage. "
"In the latter case the building is destroyed first before the target "
"behind it can be damaged, like walls around a walled in structure."

"Only enemy buildings' solidity will be considered. Units will not try to "

"Setting the Apocalypse Tank weapon's projectile to \\ :tag:`SolidLevel=1`"

"Setting a gate to :tag:`SolidHeight=-1` and :tag:`SolidLevel=0` will make"
" it a Solid Building still, but units will try to tear it down while "
"trying to shoot at a target behind it, just like walls. If the gate is "
"closed, it will take damage when units try to hit a target behind it, but"
" when it is open, the projectiles will pass."
