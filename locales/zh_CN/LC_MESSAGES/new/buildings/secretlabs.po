"The original Secret Lab system had three separate global flags to control"
" the boons and did not allow for :type:`AircraftTypes` to be granted. "
"Secret Lab logic also had some flaws which have been resolved (see "
":doc:`/bugfixes/type1/index`)."

"In :game:`Ares`, the boon is only picked after the building is first "
"captured by a :tag:`MultiplayPassive=no` country, or assigned to it if "
"pre-placed on the map. The boon ultimately offered is picked at random, "
"but only boons that are not presently buildable by the owner of the "
"Secret Lab are eligible to be selected."

"This logic has been extended with the following 'per building' flags. "
":tag:`SecretLab=yes` must be set on the building before it will be "
"treated as a Secret Lab and so allow these flags to be considered."

"Whether the Secret Lab shall re-pick the boon to be offered every time "

"Each possible boon can specify the following flags. Both are only checked"
