"This section covers several new features that were designed together in "
"order to allow mod authors to add occupiable trenches to the game. These "
"features do not all have to be used together to implement trenches though"
" - each feature has been designed to be customizable and can be used "
"separately."

"This means that these individual features do not distinguish between "
"buildings that are a trench and buildings that are not. It is important "
