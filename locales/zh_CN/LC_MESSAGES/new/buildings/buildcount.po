"In the original game, AI base planning would allow for a structure to not"
" be built, or built exactly one time. There are special cases for power "
"plants, which fill up the base plan so the house always has enough power,"
" defenses, which are picked depending on the enemy army's strength, and "
"refineries, which have special settings to support multiple instances."

"In :game:`Ares` it is not only possible to define the number of instances"
" to build by difficulty, but also to randomize this number to some "
"extent. The AI will build a random number of instances from build count "
"to build count plus extra count."

"Additional buildings are not built one after another, but instead mix "
"randomly with the structures in the build list planned to be built later."
" For example, the AI will not always build four barracks before building "
"a war factory, though by chance it could do that at times."
