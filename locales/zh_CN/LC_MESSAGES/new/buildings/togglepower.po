"The power toggling feature has been removed from :game:`Red Alert 2`, and"
" thus neither the sidebar button nor the power off building overlay were "
"available. A workaround using a fake super weapon was possible, but it "
"did not work well. :game:`Ares` adds this feature back (though not the "
"sidebar button)."

"By default, this keyboard command is disabled: Even though it is shown "
