":tag:`Gunner=yes` units support changing their weapon depending on their "
"first passenger. While it was quite versatile for players and while it "
"supported some customization for modders, this logic added in :game:`Red "
"Alert 2` was rather rigidly hardcoded internally. :game:`Ares` changes "
"this."

"The :tag:`[FV]` was the only unit to be checked for the special turret "
"and weapon flags, such as :tag:`SniperTurretIndex`. With :game:`Ares`, "
"all :type:`VehicleTypes` with :tag:`Gunner=yes` set will read those "
"flags. This means that you can now have multiple types of IFV."

":game:`Ares` supports more than 18 different turret and barrel voxels, "
"which means :tag:`TurretCount` now can be set to values greater than "
":value:`18`. :tag:`TurretCount` values greater than :value:`127` are not "
"supported, though."

"Also, units having multiple turrets enabled by the use of "
":tag:`TurretCount` have been expanded to support more than 18 weapons "
"along with their elite counterparts, thus more than 18 different "
":tag:`IFVMode`\\ s are now possible."

":game:`Ares` replaces the original parsing of the tags mapping weapons to"
" turrets like :tag:`InitiateWeaponIndex` and :tag:`InitiateTurretIndex`. "
"No longer are the values applied even though the weapon index is "
":value:`-1` (which is the default and which usually resulted in "
"corruptions and crashes). :tag:`Gunner=yes` units will not change "
"properties if their section is defined for example in a map file without "
"restating all those mappings."

"For the additional :tag:`IFVMode`\\ s :game:`Ares` adds an alternative "
"way to define which turret to use for which weapon using a single tag "
"each. Also, a warning message is put into the debug log if an index is "
"set to an invalid value."

"Note that this is different from the original game's approach which "
