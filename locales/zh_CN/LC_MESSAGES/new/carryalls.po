"Carryalls were a feature of :game:`Tiberian Sun`. :type:`AircraftTypes` "
"with :tag:`Carryall=yes` could pick up :type:`UnitTypes` from the "
"battlefield, carry them around the map and place them anywhere. The "
"carryall logic was not used in :game:`Red Alert 2` and was not updated "
"for naval units and other new features. :game:`Ares` updates the logic "
"and adds new options."
