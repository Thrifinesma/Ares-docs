"The global :tag:`[CombatDamage]BallisticScatter` is used for defining a "
"range depending on the projectile's properties, and then randomly picking"
" a value from this range as the final scatter distance for each "
"projectile fired. :game:`Ares` makes this global customizable as two "
"separate tags that can be used to specify the minimum and maximum "
"distances for each :type:`Projectile` directly."

"\\ :tag:`Inaccurate=yes` prevents projectiles to \"snap\" to their target"
" on impact, and thus they will not deal damage to them because this does "
"not count as a direct hit even if ballistic scatter is set to a low "
"value. Using \\ :tag:`CellSpread` fixes this."

"projectiles with both :tag:`FlakScatter=yes` and :tag:`Inviso=yes` set."
