"The split weapon of the Cyborg Reaper from :game:`Firestorm` fired two "
"missiles. Each of them split in mid-air after gaining some altitude, "
"releasing two new projectiles each, which would either travel on to the "
"initial target, aim for a new target no more than two cells nearby, or "
"impact on a random cell in a 7 by 7 area."

":value:`19`, and its :tag:`Bright` setting is now also respected instead "
"of just being disabled. In :game:`Ares`, :tag:`Splits` only targets air "
