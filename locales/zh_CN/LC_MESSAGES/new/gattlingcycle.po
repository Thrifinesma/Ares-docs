"The gattling weapon system in :game:`Yuri's Revenge` switches weapons the"
" longer it keeps firing. Once the highest stage is reached, it will  "
"maintain the last weapon until the target is destroyed or the unit is "
"given another order."

"By the use of :tag:`FireOnce=yes` on the last weapon stage the gattling "
"can be made to switch back to the first stage and start spinning up "
"again. This workaround comes with side effects; the most notable is that "
"the unit will lose its target and thus may not fire at a single unit "
"continuously."

"When the last :tag:`Stage` or :tag:`EliteStage` is completed, the counter"
" will wrap around and restart with the first stage without the firing "
"unit losing target. Requires :tag:`IsGattling=yes`. Defaults to "
":value:`no`."

"The gattling firing effect depends on the stage and :tag:`RateUp` and \\ "
":tag:`RateDown` values as well as the individual state of the firing "
"unit. It is not possible to guarantee that a certain stage fires a fixed "
"amount of times."
