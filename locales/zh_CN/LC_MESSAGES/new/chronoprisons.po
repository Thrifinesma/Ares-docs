"Originally intended for :game:`Yuri's Revenge`, with published concept "
"art and even appearing on the original version of the box art, the Chrono"
" Prison was planned as a unit which would suck units into a \"containment"
" sphere\" in its turret; the turret would grow with each unit sucked in, "
"and if the prison were destroyed, the units would be free again. "
