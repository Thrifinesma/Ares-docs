":game:`Ares` adds support for multiple index and bag files, which make it"
" easier to deliver sounds while also decreasing the mod's file sizes "
"potentially. First :file:`audio.idx` is read as before, and then all "
"files from :file:`audio01.idx` to :file:`audio99.idx`, with the actual "
"data in the corresponding :file:`.bag` file."

"Index files loaded later can override sound files that were included "
"earlier, thus it is possible to update sound files using relatively small"
" bag files for patches."
