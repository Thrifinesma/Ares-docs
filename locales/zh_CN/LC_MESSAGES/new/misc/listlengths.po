"There are several INI flags that take a comma-separated list of values. "
"The game imposes a maximum length for INI flag values of 128 characters "
"which isn't always long enough for lists -- especially with some of the "
"extensions that :game:`Ares` allows. This limit has been relaxed *for "
"flags that take lists* -- the maximum length for flags that take lists is"
" now 512 characters (including tag name and equal sign)."
