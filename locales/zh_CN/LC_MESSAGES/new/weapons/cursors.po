"It is now possible in :game:`Ares` to customize the weapon cursors to "
"give certain special weapons dedicated attack cursors."

msgid ""
"With these cursors, it's also possible to mimic the behavior of the "
":tag:`SabotageCursor` and :tag:`MigAttackCursor` special cases. If both "
"are set to the same cursor, they behave like the two mentioned tags, "
"which also work independent of range, like the C4 special ability cursor."
" Also, this is useful for suicide units like the Terrorist or the "
"Demolition Truck, which are almost always out of range."

"If two or more units are selected, this cursor is not used. Note that "
"deployed units will get their No Move cursor instead, as they would have "
"to, but cannot move."

#: ../new/weapons/cursors.rst:41
msgid ""
"There's no cursor to show in case a unit cannot attack a target (for "
"instance it might not be mind-controllable, etc.), because the game does "
"not have a concept of this. Instead the next type of cursor is checked, "
"and sometimes the inability to attack gets converted to a different "
"action like move, no move, or select (or something entirely different "
"like enter for Engineer infantry)."
