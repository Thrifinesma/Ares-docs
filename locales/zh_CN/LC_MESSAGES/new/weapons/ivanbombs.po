"As with many other features of :game:`Yuri's Revenge`, the settings that "
"control Crazy Ivan Bombs are global so you cannot have multiple "
"variations of them with their own controls. With :game:`Ares` it is now "
"possible to create new Ivan Bomb-esque weapons -- new types of sticky "
"bomb with whatever settings you like."

":game:`Ares` adds the Death Bombs feature, which was originally planned "

"then, or the owner manually detonates it, if allowed."
