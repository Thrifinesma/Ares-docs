"The level deactivated voxel :type:`VehicleTypes` are dimmed can be "
"configured here. The first applicable value is used, the other values "
"will not be considered. That is, if an unpowered unit is under EMP, "
":tag:`DeactivateDimEMP` is used. This is purely cosmetic and the order "
"may change in the future. A value of :value:`1.0` disables the dimming "
"effect. Supported range is :value:`0.0` to :value:`1.0`, higher values "
"will brighten the unit."
