"The cost reduction effect of :tag:`FactoryPlant` buildings like the "
"Industrial Plant can be modified per :type:`TechnoType`, using this "
"multiplier."

"The effect of the respective :tag:`CostBonus` tag for this type is "
"multiplied by this value to either increase, decrease, or nullify the "
"effect. Fully supported values range from :value:`-1.0` to reverse the "
"effect to :value:`1.0` to not apply the effect. :value:`0.0` nullifies "
"the bonus. Defaults to :value:`1.0`."

msgid ""
"Values beyond :value:`1.0` can potentially cause the cost to drop to "
"zero, if the effect of the product of all cost bonuses is multiplied by a"
" too large value. This is because the effect of this multiplier is "
"linear."

"An example: If the cost bonus is :value:`0.6` and the multiplier is "
":value:`0.5`, then the final bonus will be :value:`0.8`. In other words: "
"if a bonus reduces the cost to 60% and the multiplier only grants half of"
" that, the final price will be at 80% of the original cost."
