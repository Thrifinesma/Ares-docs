":tag:`OmniCrusher=yes` units are allowed to overrun enemies, and units "
"are eager to try that when ordered to attack a victim, or when "
"retaliating against an enemy unit firing at it. This mechanism is "
"sometimes useful, but sometimes it is not. Like when a Battle Fortress "
"deliberately closes in on a group of enemy tanks, and is then lured into "
"an ambush and overpowered itself."
