":game:`Tiberian Sun` had wildlife, which was yet more aggressive than "
":game:`Red Alert 2`'s cows. Among them was the Tiberian Fiend, which hid "
"in patches of Tiberium and could attack and heavily damage units and "
"structures on the battlefield. :game:`Ares` recreates this remarkably "
"nasty piece of fauna."

"Whether this unit exhibits Tiberian Fiend behavior: Sitting down on "
"Tiberium when in guard mode, aborting attack missions and running for "
"Tiberium when badly hurt, and being easily aggravated. Requires "
":tag:`Crawls=yes`, otherwise the unit will not sit down on Tiberium, as "
"well as :tag:`NotHuman=yes` to not show human death animations when "
"killed. Defaults to :value:`no`."
