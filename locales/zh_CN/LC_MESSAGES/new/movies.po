"With :game:`Ares` the in-game movies list can be customized and new "
"unlockable movies can be added. Each movie is now unlocked individually "
"instead of using only two campaign progression trackers for Allies and "
"Soviets. The unlocked state is saved in a new section called "
":tag:`[UnlockedMovies]` in :file:`ra2md.ini`."

"In the new file :file:`moviemd.ini`, add all movie filenames without the "
":file:`.BIK` extension to the :tag:`[Movies]` list. All movies will "
"appear on the in-game menu in the same order as in this list. Only if the"
" list is empty does the game default to the original behavior using the "
"hardcoded movie lists and the two progression trackers."
