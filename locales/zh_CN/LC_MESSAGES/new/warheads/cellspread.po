":game:`Yuri's Revenge` used a lookup table to iterate all the cells "
"affected by area of effect weapons using :tag:`CellSpread`. This lookup "
"table was limited because it only supported a maximum range of 11 (which "
"contained errors)."

#: ../new/warheads/cellspread.rst:17
msgid ""
":game:`Ares` replaces this lookup table and makes it possible to use "
"larger values for :tag:`CellSpread`. All area of effect weapon features "
":game:`Ares` added (like :doc:`AttachEffects on Warheads "
"</new/attacheffect>`, :doc:`EMP </restored/emp>`, :ref:`IronCurtain on "
"Weapons <wh-ironcurtain>`) have been updated to support this as well."

"Consider: If you double the range, the number of affected cells is "
"quadrupled. For performance reasons it is not advised to use "
":tag:`CellSpread` for frequent or map wide effects."

msgid ""
"The :tag:`CellSpread` logic iterates all cells in range, and affects all "
"objects on these cells. If an object occupies more than one cell like "
"buildings with a foundation larger than 1x1, it could be encountered "
"multiple times and thus would take multiple hits (potentially one for "
"each cell of its foundation)."

"The following tag limits the number of times the same object can be hit "
"by the same cause. If an object is hit more often than allowed, the hits "
"closest to the impact site are used, all others are discarded."

"The number of times an object can be affected at most when hit by a "
"warhead using :tag:`CellSpread`. Set this to :value:`1` to make the same "
"object not be hit not more than once. Defaults to :value:`-1` (infinite)."
