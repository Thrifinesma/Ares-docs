"In :game:`Yuri's Revenge` the nuke uses a special animation called "
":tag:`NUKEBALL` which was shown prior to displaying the actual mushroom "
"explosion and dealing damage. The game was hard-coded to use this only "
"for warheads with the ID :tag:`NUKE`. :game:`Ares` enables this for "
"arbitrary warheads."
