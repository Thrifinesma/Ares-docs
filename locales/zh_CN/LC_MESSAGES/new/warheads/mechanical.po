":game:`Yuri's Revenge` was hardcoded to only allow infantry to heal other"
" infantry and repair vehicles to only repair other vehicles. :game:`Ares`"
" removes this hardcoding and now :type:`InfantryTypes` and "
":type:`VehicleTypes` can heal or repair all :type:`TechnoTypes` depending"
" on verses. This allows creating Mechanics as known from :game:`The "
"Aftermath` as well as Ambulances known from :game:`Generals`."
