"This warhead effect can be used to temporarily jam the target unit, so it"
" will not be able to fire its weapons. It will still be able to reload, "
"target a victim and even passively acquire new targets, and death weapons"
" will still be set off when the target is killed or destroyed. Also note "
"that special effects like C4 are not disabled."
