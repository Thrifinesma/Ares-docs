msgid ""
"This logic is inspired by the MAD Tank known from the :game:`Red Alert` "
"mission disk :game:`The Aftermath`, where it was used as a large area of "
"effect weapon that damaged each victim by taking away a share of its "
"health."

"Instead of using a fixed damage value, a value relative to the victim's "
":tag:`Strength` or current health can be dealt by a warhead. Country "
"armor multipliers and veterancy bonuses are still applied, as well as "
":tag:`Verses`."

"Relative Damage is not supported on special weapon logics like "
":tag:`Temporal` or :tag:`Psychedelic` warheads, and also doesn't support "
":tag:`ProneDamage` and :tag:`DeployedDamage` for infantry. Suppressing "
"parasites is also not supported."

"Deal damage relative to :tag:`Strength` or current health instead of "

"A dummy :tag:`Damage` is needed on this warhead for targeting, even "
