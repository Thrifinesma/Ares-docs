"Specifies the animation to display when an :type:`InfantryType` (with "
":tag:`NotHuman=no`) is killed by this warhead. Works in the same way as "
"existing :tag:`InfDeath` animations except this flag allows you to "
"specify an animation ID rather than an integer. Furthermore, the "
"animation will be treated as the correct type (e.g. mutation or non-"
"mutation) automatically, which means that you can now have any number of "
"mutations that produce player-owned :tag:`InfantryTypes`. See "
":doc:`MakeInfantryOwner </new/makeinfantryowner>` for how to control "
"which player will gain control of 'mutated' infantry."
