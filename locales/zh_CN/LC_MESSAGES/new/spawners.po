"Spawners have been enhanced to support cloak. A cloaking Destroyer or "
"Aircraft Carrier will not cause all its spawns to self-destruct any more."
" Spawners now have rudimentary support for :tag:`BalloonHover=yes`."

"Non-Missile spawns were always put on the ground for take-off, even if "
"the carrier was in the air. This has been changed and spawns now start "
"from the carrier."

"Spawned units now return to :tag:`BalloonHover=yes` spawners, instead of "
"flying off the map and potentially crashing the game. If the spawner unit"
" is moving, it is possible that the spawns lower on the wrong cell and "
"then gain altitude again."

#: ../new/spawners.rst:27
msgid ""
"For best effects, the :tag:`FlightLevel` of spawns should be higher than "
"the :tag:`FlightLevel` of the spawning unit. Otherwise the spawns would "
"disappear from mid-air when docking, or even try to lower down to the "
"ground instead of going up to the carrier."

"Please note that this logics still has some shortcomings and it has many "
"opportunities for improvements. For example, move sounds do not work "
"correctly once a spawn has launched once."
