"In the original game the sides and countries were, for the most part, "
"hard-coded. You could not add to, remove or reorder the 10 countries or 3"
" sides. :game:`Ares`, however, makes these tasks possible -- you can now "
"have up to 16 fully functional countries and sides, and you can customize"
" these in numerous ways..."
