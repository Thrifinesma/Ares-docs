"Instead of dealing damage directly using the :tag:`Warhead`, a weapon can"
" be defined to create a projectile and detonate it immediately. This "
"allows some weapon effects to be applied."

"The weapon used to deliver animation damage. If set, creates a projectile"
" and detonates it immediately. The damage delivered is defined by the "
"animation, not the weapon."

"The weapon has to be known to the game already, otherwise it cannot be "
"parsed correctly. It is recommended to add it to the :type:`WeaponTypes` "
"list."

#: ../new/animations.rst:22
msgid ""
"Currently, the created projectile is neither owned by the player who "
"created the animation nor the owner of the unit or structure the "
"animation is attached to. While damage delivered using :tag:`Warhead` at "
"least knows about the player who created the animation for scoring "
"purposes, weapon damage does not pass on this information. This might "
"change in the future."

"The delay between two applications of animation damage. Requires "
":tag:`Damage` greater than or equal to :value:`1.0`. A value of "
":value:`0` disables the delay. Defaults to :value:`0`."

#: ../new/animations.rst:39
msgid ""
"Mind that this value is measured in animation frames: depending on "
":tag:`Rate`, the animation might not advance to the next animation frame "
"every game frame."
