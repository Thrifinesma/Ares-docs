"When aircraft creates a smoke trail because of heavy damage, the "
"animation used is hardcoded and the same for all :type:`AircraftTypes`, "
"yet it is looked up each time anew for every aircraft anyhow. When an "
"aircraft is destroyed, it creates lots of smoke animations. This fix gets"
" rid of the superfluous lookup. Additionally, the smoke has been made "
"customizable per :type:`AircraftType`."
