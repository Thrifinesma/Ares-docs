"If a unit attacked a member of an idling team in :game:`Tiberian Sun` and"
" didn't kill it right away, the team would collectively retaliate against"
" the offender. This logic has been removed from :game:`Red Alert 2` and "
":game:`Ares` brings it back as an optional feature."

"While the original logic just ignored :type:`AircraftTypes`, the restored"
" logic also excludes :tag:`ConsideredAircraft=yes` units and parasites. "
"Another difference is that the team members' current targets are no "
"longer reset when a second offender attacks the team, which might prevent"
" target juggling in case of multiple attackers."

"This feature can only be enabled globally using a tag to not change the "
"original game's behavior. Also, :game:`Ares` does not extend "
":type:`TeamTypes` yet to allow custom tags per team."
