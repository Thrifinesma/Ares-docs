msgid ""
"Like :tag:`EMPulseCannon`, this disallows players to manually select "
"targets, but it neither prevents the object from picking its own targets "
"automatically, nor to retaliate."

"Whether players may not select targets for this type of object manually. "
"If enabled, units will have to rely on auto-targeting and retaliation "
"rules. Defaults to :value:`no`."

#: ../new/manual.rst:32
msgid ""
"This setting disallows players to manually eject the passengers. This is "
"useful for vehicles that are no real transports, like :doc:`Chrono "
"Prisons </new/chronoprisons>`."

#: ../new/manual.rst:36
msgid ""
"By default, passengers might still be ejected when the vehicle is "
"destroyed. To change this, set the :doc:`Passenger Survivor Chance "

msgid "No Manual Enter Transport"
msgstr ""

#: ../new/manual.rst:56
msgid ""
"This cosmetic setting allows to hide the fact that a unit is a transport "
"by removing the enter and no-enter cursors."
msgstr ""

#: ../new/manual.rst:59
msgid ""
"This does not prevent units from entering by other means, like scripts, "

"Whether units will not get an enter or no-enter cursor when on this "

msgid "No Guard Area on Self"
msgstr ""

#: ../new/manual.rst:78
msgid ""
"Medics usually get a guard area cursor on themselves so players can set "
"them to guard mode by clicking. This prevents infantry with negative "
"damage weapons to have deploy ability. :game:`Ares` adds a tag to turn "
"this feature off."

msgstr ""

#: ../new/manual.rst:83
msgid ""
"Whether infantry units with negative damage weapons get the guard area "
"cursor on themselves. If :value:`no`, the guard area cursor will not take"
" precedence, allowing other cursors like the deploy cursor to be shown. "
"Defaults to :value:`no`."
