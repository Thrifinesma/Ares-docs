"Animations can spawn particles using :tag:`SpawnsParticle`, but no matter"
" how many are spawned, they would always spawn at the exact same location"
" as the animation. These new tags allow customizing the distance from the"

"This feature divides the circle around animation's base coords into "
":tag:`NumParticles` sections. Each section will get exactly one spawned "
"particle. The height above ground will be the same as the animation's "
