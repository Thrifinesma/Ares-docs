"When an Internal Error occurs, the :file:`except.txt` file that is "
"produced has been modified so as to output more information that is both "
"relevant to mod authors, and also relevant to us, the developers, when "
"debugging the changes and additions introduced by :game:`Ares`."

":game:`Ares` will give you the option to produce a crash dump file to "
"assist in determining the cause of the error. This file will be stored in"
" a Debug folder within the main game directory. Note that the crash dump "
"file is very large and may only be readable by the :game:`Ares` "
"developers. Like :file:`except.txt`, this file will include a timestamp "
"in the filename."

"If you have turned on debug logging (see :doc:`Command Line Arguments "
"</ui-features/commandlinearguments>` and :ref:`Debug Logging <debug-"
"logging>`) then the game will produce a :file:`debug.log` file in the "
"aforementioned Debug folder. Like :file:`except.txt`, this file will "
"include a timestamp in the filename. The log file may contain useful "
"information for helping diagnose problems with your mod or :game:`Ares` "
"itself."
