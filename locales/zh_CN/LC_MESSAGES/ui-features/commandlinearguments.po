"Controls which processors the game will run on. :value:`N` is a bit mask "
"with one bit for each processor starting with :value:`1` for the first, "
":value:`2` for the second, :value:`4` for the third and so on. If not "

"Several bits can be combined, like :value:`3` representing the first two "
"processors. Usually, the game should run on only one processor (that is, "
":value:`N` being a power of 2), as it is not designed to make use of "
"multiple processors."
