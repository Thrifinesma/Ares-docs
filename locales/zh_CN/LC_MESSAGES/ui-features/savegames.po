"If :game:`Ares` detects a mismatch while reading its own data and is thus"
" unable to proceed loading a save game file, it will automatically and "
"forcefully terminate the game, no error message will be shown, and the "
"game will not return back to the main menu. This should not happen if you"
" follow these guidelines. For debugging purposes, the log file will then "
"contain information about the last object :game:`Ares` tried to restore."
